The conference will take place in the lovely city of Leiria, Portugal. Just a mere 140km from the capital Lisbon, Leiria offers everything you would expect from an international conference host.

The venue is located in the Leiria Municipal Stadium (Dr. Magalhães Pessoa), right next to the Castle, just a few meters from the river.

In here you will find an exhibition area for companies/businesses that sponsor the event, a meal/bar area where you can get a snack or coffee and of course, you'll find our stage for the talks and rooms for the workshops.

In the vicinity of the stadium, you'll have plenty of choice regarding lunch and dinner options. Feel free to browse our local gastronomy in the partner restaurants where you can get a special price, or venture out beyond that.

Regarding transportation, the stadium is a 10 minute walk from the city center, where you'll have everything you need for the two day stay over at our city.

When you're choosing where to stay the night at Leiria, remember that we have a few partnerships in order to get you better prices.

At night we'll host a pub crawl through some bars in the city where you can get to meet or chat with other participants or speakers in the conference.

Welcome to Leiria!
